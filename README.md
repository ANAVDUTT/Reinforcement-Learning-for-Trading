# Time-Series-Forecasting-Project---Anav-Dutt-Senior-Seminar-Fall-2021
This project analyses 4 different machine learning models, being XGBoost, ARIMA, Long-Short Term Memory, and Facebook Prophet. My purpose is to look at how these modelling programs would interact with different asset classe sand which ones would be the best predictors for each.
I wanted to look at different asset classes so that when analyzing these models I would be able to take into account different levels of volatility, seasonality, fluctuations, and trends. 
The purpose behind this project is to see how time series forecasting is important, and how machine learning models perform in high pressuresituations.
